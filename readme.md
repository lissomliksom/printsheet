# Printsheet.css

This is my css print-design stylesheet. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

*Important note:* This is a tool for designing in A4 format. It does not optimize any page to print design. 

## Use

Include printsheet.css and start making your print design.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="printsheet.css">
```

Use classes *portrait* / *landscape* to set page direction.

Use classes *standard* / *narrow* to set page padding.

```html
<div class="portrait">
  <div class="standard">
    All content
  </div>
</div>
```

## Demo
